# Remote Control Cardboard Box

The remote control cardboard box robot uses a standard ("universal") infrared TV remote and a infrared receiver to control a cardboard box with two motorized wheels. You analyze your remote to see what messages it's sending, and use your data to choose which buttons cause which actions on the box robot.
